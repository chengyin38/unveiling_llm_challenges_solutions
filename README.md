# Unveiling LLM Challenges and their Emerging Solutions

Presented at [UC Berkeley AI Hackathon June 2023](https://ai.calhacks.io/)

Abstract:

Recent large language model (LLM) development is hastening many organizations to adopt LLMs in order to stay relevant. Under the facade of the seeming omnipotence of LLMs lies many risks and limitations that we, as builders and users of such technology, must consider and overcome. The audience will walk away from this talk having a more holistic understanding of the opportunities and challenges of LLMs, and how these considerations inform the suite of emerging solutions and how they may pave future LLM development.
